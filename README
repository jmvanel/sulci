Sulci
=====

Sulci is a French text mining tool, initially designed for the analysis of
the corpus and thesaurus of `Libération <http://www.liberation.fr/>`_, a 
french newspaper.

This code is "work in progress"; it's not used (nor usable) in production yet.

Still, it provides the following text mining algorithms; each consists of
a training routine and an analysis routine:

* POS (part-of-speech) tagging -- using an algorithm similar to Brill's;
* lemmatization;
* semantical tagging (somehow similar to a neural network).


Sample usage::

  >> from sulci.textmining import SemanticalTagger
  >> my_text = u"Voici mon magnifique texte en français qui parle de Charlie Chaplin en Europe."
  >> S = SemanticalTagger(my_text)
  >> S.descriptors()
  Charlie Chaplin
  Europe
